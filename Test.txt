Subject: Team Member Workload Evaluation and Utilization

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on the workload and utilization of our team member, [Team Member's Name], who is primarily responsible for UI development.

After a thorough review of our current projects and tasks, it appears that [Team Member's Name]'s skills and work time are not being fully utilized. As you know, UI development is a critical aspect of our projects, but the volume of tasks in this area has been relatively low recently.

This underutilization does not reflect on [Team Member's Name]'s capabilities or performance, but rather on the current distribution of tasks within our team. I believe that this situation presents us with an opportunity to optimize our resources and potentially expand [Team Member's Name]'s role to include other tasks that could benefit from his skills and expertise.

I am open to discussing this further and exploring potential solutions to ensure that all team members are fully engaged and that their skills are being utilized effectively. Your guidance and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
