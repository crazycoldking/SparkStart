Absolutely, access control is a crucial aspect of any system, especially when consolidating multiple services into a single URL. Here are some strategies to ensure effective access control:

User Authentication: Implement a robust user authentication system to verify the identity of users. This could be based on usernames and passwords, two-factor authentication, or even biometric data.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities and provide access to resources accordingly. For example, an 'Admin' role might have access to all resources, while a 'User' role might only have access to specific dashboards.

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): This is a more flexible approach where access rights are granted based on attributes such as the user's role, location, time of access, etc.

Access Logs: Maintain detailed logs of all access requests and activities. This can help in auditing and identifying any unauthorized access attempts.

Regular Audits: Conduct regular audits to ensure that access control policies are being followed and to identify any potential security gaps.

Remember, the goal of access control is not just to restrict access, but to ensure that users have the appropriate access needed to perform their tasks efficiently and securely. It's a delicate balance between security and usability.
